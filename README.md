# Professional-Portfolio

## Description

My motivation was to make something where I can show my skills and what I am capable of.

I built my professional portfolio to show who I am to whoever wants to know about me and what I have done.

This portfolio solves the problem of someone wanting to learn about me.

I learned how to resize the page by using @media and I also learned how to set colors to words by using root.

## Usage

This project is my professional portfolio. The use for it is for me to show you what I am capable of. My name is at the top of the page and there are also navigation text to the right of my name that will take you to where you want to see. My picture is to the left of my name. The rest of the webpage is filled with my about me, the projects that I have done and a place with my contact information.
